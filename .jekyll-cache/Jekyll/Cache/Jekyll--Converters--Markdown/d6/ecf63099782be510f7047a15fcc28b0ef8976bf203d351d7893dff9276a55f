I"¯<h2 id="welcome-to-my-blog">Welcome to my blog!</h2>

<p>Since this is the first post of my blog, I will talk about what kind of topics I will post here.</p>

<p>As I said in the presentation of the website, Iâ€™m a spanish developer since 2011.</p>

<p>Consequently, the main topics that will be discussed here will be about the developmwnt of the projects I maintain at the moment. Also, I will post tutorials on the fly about doubts that arise me when I develop (that I could figure out). Either, I will post old doubts.</p>

<p>Little by little and when I have time and ideas, I will post about other kind of topics (that come to my mind).</p>

<p><strong>Best regards!</strong></p>
