## Welcome to my blog!

Since this is the first post of my blog, I will talk about what kind of topics I will post here.

As I said in the presentation of the website, I'm a spanish developer since 2011.

Consequently, the main topics that will be discussed here will be about the developmwnt of the projects I maintain at the moment. Also, I will post tutorials on the fly about doubts that arise me when I develop (that I could figure out). Either, I will post old doubts.

Little by little and when I have time and ideas, I will post about other kind of topics (that come to my mind).

**Best regards!**
